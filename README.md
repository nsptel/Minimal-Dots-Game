# Minimal-Dots-Game
A simple console game developed using Python programming language, as a side project. This game can be played by multiple people where they have to connect the dots of the board and create boxes. When the board is full or the users quit the game in between, the current progress shows the winner. Winner is decided based on who has the most amount of boxes with their player ids in them. I worked on this project in my free time and it's not associated with my studies or profession.
